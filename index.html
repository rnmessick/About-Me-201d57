      <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I've often sought jobs that interested me in some way. I never really knew what I wanted to do with myself so I spent a lot of time in college but this also meant working a lot of retail jobs. </p>
        <p>I've worked for Starbucks. That lasted about 3 1/2 years.</p>
        <p>I've worked for a few different bookstores including Barnes & Nobel and Books Inc. I believe Books Inc is native to the Bay Area</p>

        <p>I've been on a journey to find a way to make my career meaningful and satisfying on multple fronts. After years of exploring my options, I believe Software Development may be the career I've always wanted. I'm a  natural healer and creator so I plan on utilizing these innate abilities in everything I do.</p>
